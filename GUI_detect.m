function varargout = GUI_detect(varargin)
% GUI_DETECT M-file for GUI_detect.fig
%      GUI_DETECT, by itself, creates a new GUI_DETECT or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = GUI_DETECT returns the handle to a new GUI_DETECT or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      GUI_DETECT('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in GUI_DETECT.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      GUI_DETECT('Property','Value',...) creates a new GUI_DETECT or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before GUI_detect_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to GUI_detect_OpeningFcn via varargin.

%      instance to run (singleton)".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function plots the current trace being analyzed. Various features
% can be added. Events can be shown in red with black dots on the start and
% end points. Diagnostic plot mode shows running average as a magenta line, the
% one sigma level above and below the moving average in green, and the
% detection level in red.
%
%
% Inputs:
% location - 'here' to use the handles.axes_trace plot in the GUI, or 'new'
%               to plot it in a new plot window
% show_events_on_trace - 1 also show events found, or 0 don't show events
%               if show events is turned on than handles.check_highlight_events checkbox
%               must be turned on and the vectors handles.event_time_withoutextra and
%               handles.events_local_trace_withoutextra must contain event trace
%               information, while the vectors handles.event_startstop_time and
%               handles.event_startstop_trace must have the start and stop points for all
%               events. These vectors are generated in the function fun_events_detect.

% Called By:

% function button_find_events_Callback - when the Find Events button is

%
% Inputs:
% plottingon - show the events found on the trace, this is disabled except
%               when finding manually by clicking the Find Events Button
